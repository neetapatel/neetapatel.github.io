i designed the annual "happy holidays" message for the yale school of art. this design utilizes a typeface i made called [cooper irregular](https://typedesign.yaleschoolofart.org/neeta-patel/){:target="_blank"}, and it was printed as a greeting card mailed to alums and friends of the school. this animated version was used on the school's digital communications channels.
