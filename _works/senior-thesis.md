my senior thesis show "time is a floating point number." explored mark-making, its transposition, and distribution. the title of the show was painted on the walls of the gallery using large, laser-cut stencils of the font i designed from my handwriting:

this ricoh aficio ap3800c office printer was generating automatic posters for the duration of the show. using my handwriting font and a randomized set of design parameters, it created a poster every time i tweeted using the content directly from my live twitter feed:

i spent 80 hours copying italo calvino's novel "if on a winter's night a traveler" by hand into two notebooks. i reproduced those notebooks into a set of simple perfect-bound books that were available for reading:

i also superimposed each chapter of the handwritten novel onto itself, and displayed the redacted results as large-format prints:

i made a series of daily pour over coffee paintings over the five days of the show. the ritual involved brewing coffee on top of a sheet of watercolor paper sitting in specially built and waterproofed plywood platters:

also on display was a series of photographs of black squares in the real world:

and a wooden box of ticking ikea clocks provided a gentle soundtrack to the gallery:

my handwriting font was distributed on usb sticks:

and the posters advertising the show were each uniquely generated by a program that typeset the title of the show given a set of randomized parameters:
