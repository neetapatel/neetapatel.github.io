a junior thesis group exhibition for the program in visual arts. my component included an installation of a year-long project of typesetting the weather forecast every day within strict formal constraints. i included my printer to continue the typesetting project during the show. i also created a multi-hour soundtrack of silence that played continuously, composed of recordings of friend's silences as they worked.
