i designed and developed a website to host an ongoing personal collection of analog 140-character "tweets," handwritten in gridded a6 muji notebooks (more on that [here](https://neeta.works/works/unpublished_tweets/){:target="_blank"}). tweets on the site are served to the viewer one-by-one and recede back into near-illegibility when their time is up. this site was completed as a part of the inaugural [fruitful.school](https://fruitful.school/){:target="_blank"} learning initiative for making "fruitful websites."
