i designed and developed this website to host an ongoing collection of analog, handwritten, 140-character "tweets" in gridded a6 muji notebooks. this project was completed as a part of the inaugural [fruitful.school](https://fruitful.school/){:target="_blank"} learning initiative for making "fruitful websites." more on my unpublished tweets project [here](https://neeta.works/works/unpublished_tweets/).
