i organize a small, bimonthly graphic design reading group. every two weeks, i assign two texts in and around graphic design, in the broadest sense, and we gather to discuss. in season one, we read essays related to design, visual arts,  communication, critical theory, aesthetics, writing, publishing, and feminist theory. the group began as a small set of graphic designers, and now includes members from many areas of the arts, and the country.

i designed this course reader at the conclusion of our first season. it includes reproductions of all ten readings, along with my marginalia collected during each meeting.
